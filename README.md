# Climate Ready Barcelona: User Interface Tutorial

Welcome to this tutorial on how to use [**Barcelona's Climate Vulnerability Map to Heat**](https://maps.climatereadybcn.eu), available at [maps.climatereadybcn.eu](https://maps.climatereadybcn.eu). This tool was developed within the framework of the [Climate Ready Barcelona](https://www.climatereadybcn.eu) project, funded by the [ICLEI Action Fund 2.0](https://iclei-europe.org/funding-opportunities/action-fund/).

The project was coordinated by [ECOSERVEIS](https://www.ecoserveis.net/en), and the map was primarily designed and implemented by [CIMNE](https://www.cimne.com) to support public authorities, researchers, and third-sector organizations in understanding heat-related vulnerability across the city.

Other partners involved in the project include [ABD](https://abd.ong/en/), [Bitgenoma](https://bitgenoma.com/en_US/page/homepage), and the [Barcelona City Council](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/).


‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
This tutorial is a **demonstration of the functionalities and capabilities** of the web-based map. The source code of the platform **cannot be shared**, as it is built on **MapFrame**, a proprietary framework developed by **[NAZKA Mapps](https://nazka.be)**. MapFrame is not open source and is subject to its own licensing terms.

Despite this limitation, the tutorial aims to guide users through the main features and analytical layers of the platform, helping to make the most out of this powerful visualization and decision-support tool.

## üß≠ Navigation Guide

Once logged in, you‚Äôll be able to explore the interactive map. Here's a quick overview of how to navigate:

<p align="center"><img src="figures/fig4.png" width="90%"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Figure 4. First visualisation of the map</i></p>

- **Zoom In/Out**: Use your mouse wheel to zoom in or out of the map.
- **Pan**: Click and hold the left mouse button to drag and navigate around the map.
- **Language Selection**: Click the blue button at the top right corner of the website to change the language. English, Spanish, and Catalan are available.
- **Top Panel**: Use this menu to select the functionality you wish to explore:
  - *Indicators*: Visualize real, simulated, or predicted values of various indicators related to building characteristics, historical climate conditions, demography, socioeconomics, energy, and available infrastructure.
  - *Vulnerability Index*: Display estimated vulnerability indices across the city. *(As of June 2025, only climate vulnerability due to heat is available.)*
  - *Climate Shelters*: View the locations of designated climate shelters in the city and the shelter at minimum distance to each building. You can filter them by opening hours, characteristics, and building type.
- **Left Panel**: Contains selectors, filters, and metadata for the selected variable.
- **Right Side Buttons**: Provide options for downloading datasets, selecting legends, changing background maps, and toggling data visualization.
- **Right Side Legend**: Displays the color-coded scale for the map, including units, minimum and maximum values, and mid-range values depending on the selected indicator and the type of legend selected.

## üóÇÔ∏è  Tab Explanations

The interface is divided into three tabs, each one providing access to different functionalities:

### üìç Indicators

This tab allows you to toggle and explore multiple indicators related to building characteristics, historical climate conditions, demography, socioeconomics, energy, and available infrastructure.

#### Metadata details

In the first panel dialog, the dropdown menu allows users to select one of the available indicators. In the second section, the variable‚Äôs unit is displayed using LaTeX formatting. Additionally, there is a "More details" button that opens a modal with a description of the selected indicator and the data sources used to calculate or estimate it.
   <p align="center"><img src="figures/fig5.png" width="70%"></p>
   <p align="center"><i>Figure 5. Metadata details in the indicators tab</i></p>

#### Timeline slider
In the third section of the panel, a timeline slider allows users to explore the indicator across different years. By default, the latest year with available data is selected. Some indicators, however, are only available for a single year.
   <p align="center"><img src="figures/fig6.png" width="70%"></p>
   <p align="center"><i>Figure 6. Timeline in the indicators tab</i></p>

#### Range slider
In the fourth section of the panel, a range slider allows users to limit the items depicted in the map based on its values.
   <p align="center"><img src="figures/fig7.png" width="70%"></p>
   <p align="center"><i>Figure 7. The range slider can be used to filter the indicator values over the map</i></p>

#### Layer selector 
The fifth section is optional and only appears for certain indicators. When available, it provides a list of selectable layers accessed through one of the labeled buttons.

   <p align="center"><i>Figure 8. Multi-layer indicators</i></p>

#### Building detail
Selecting one of the buildings through the map, opens a dialog where exhibits the cadastral parcel number and the value of the indicator for that building.
   <p align="center"><img src="figures/fig9.png" width="70%"></p>
   <p align="center"><i>Figure 9. </i></p>

Furthermore, if you click over Building details, a modal will be opened containing all the indicators for that building.

   <p align="center"><img src="figures/fig13.png" width="48%"> <img src="figures/fig14.png" width="48%"></p>

   <p align="center"><i>Figure 10. All the indicators available for one building</i></p>

#### Download actual layer
The indicator depicted over the map is available for downloading clicking the first button from the right-top of the map. A modal will be opened that allows downloading a GeoJSON containing the geographical layer and the data layer. Also the JSON containing the metadata of the indicator can be downloaded.

   <p align="center"><i>Figure 12. An example GeoJSON file downloaded from our web opened in QGIS and an example of the JSON file containing the metadata</i></p>

#### Legend colouring distribution method
The legend can be set to either linear or quantile mode using the second button from the top. In the linear mode, the colour scale is evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum values of the indicator. In the quantile mode, the colour scale is based on the statistical distribution of the data, so the midpoint corresponds to the 50th percentile (median) of the indicator values.

<p align="center"><i>Figure 13. Types of legend colouring distribution (quantile on the left, linear on the right)</i></p>

#### Change of background layers
The third button from the top allows to vary the background map between three types: basic (default), detailed and satellite. Finally, with the fourth button from the top, the coloured polygons can be turn to invisible if the user wants to focus uniquely on the background map.

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

The Climate Vulnerability Map to Heat is designed to support **climate adaptation planning**, **urban design**, and **public health strategies** by offering spatialized, integrative data on how heat impacts Barcelona‚Äôs population.

Although the underlying software for the UI is proprietary and not publicly available, this tutorial offers a detailed walk-through to help users understand and apply the platform‚Äôs functionalities.

We encourage you to explore the different layers, combine datasets, and use the insights provided to support evidence-based decision making.
