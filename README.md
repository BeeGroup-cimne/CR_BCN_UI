# Climate Ready Barcelona: Heat Vulnerability Map Tutorial

Welcome to this tutorial on how to use the **Climate Vulnerability Map to Heat** available at [maps.climatereadybcn.eu](https://maps.climatereadybcn.eu). This tool was developed within the framework of the [Climate Ready Barcelona](https://www.climatereadybcn.eu) project, led by ECOSERVEIS and developed by CIMNE, to support public authorities, researchers, and citizens in understanding heat-related vulnerability across the city.

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
This tutorial is a **demonstration of the functionalities and capabilities** of the web-based map. The source code of the platform **cannot be shared**, as it is built on **MapFrame**, a proprietary framework developed by **NAZKA Mapps**. MapFrame is not open source and is subject to its own licensing terms.

Despite this limitation, the tutorial aims to guide users through the main features and analytical layers of the platform, helping to make the most out of this powerful visualization and decision-support tool.

## 🗂️ Tab Explanations

The interface is divided into several key tabs, each providing access to different functionalities:

### 📍 Layers

This tab allows you to toggle and explore multiple thematic layers, including:

- **Vulnerability Index**: Composite indicator assessing the vulnerability to heat across different city zones.
- **Population at Risk**: Displays vulnerable groups such as elderly population or children.
- **Heat Exposure**: Shows historical and projected temperature patterns.
- **Urban Features**: Buildings, green areas, and land use layers.

You can adjust layer **opacity**, **reorder**, or **combine layers** for comparative analysis.

### 📊 Data Panels

Clicking on a location or area brings up a **data panel** summarizing key metrics:

- Vulnerability score
- Socioeconomic indicators
- Urban characteristics
- Climate exposure data

These panels allow you to **interpret data per unit of analysis**, such as census sections or neighborhoods.

### 📤 Export and Reports

Some versions of the platform allow exporting maps or generating short reports. If enabled for your user account:

- Use the export button to download screenshots of the current map view.
- Use report buttons to get PDF summaries of specific zones.

## ✅ Conclusions

The Climate Vulnerability Map to Heat is designed to support **climate adaptation planning**, **urban design**, and **public health strategies** by offering spatialized, integrative data on how heat impacts Barcelona’s population.

Although the underlying software is proprietary and not publicly available, this tutorial offers a detailed walk-through to help users understand and apply the platform’s functionalities.

We encourage you to explore the different layers, combine datasets, and use the insights provided to support evidence-based decision making.
